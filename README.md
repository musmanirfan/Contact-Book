**Server:** ASP.NET Core Web API, MSSQL Server, Entity Framework Core  

**IDE/Tools:** Microsoft Visual Studio, Microsoft Visual Studio Code, Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio

## Documentation

**Project Description:** In this project I've tried to build a contact book, which will keep all the contact details. The basic CRUD operations have been implemented to make this project functional, which are Create, Read, Update and Delete any record.

**Back-end Task:** I've chosen ASP.NET Core 6 Web API backend framework to build and generate the REST APIs which are POST (create), GET (read), PUT (update) and DELETE (delete) by communicating with the database. The APIs of this project follow the RESTful Web Service and HTTP protocol and are documented with the help of Swagger API Documentation Support. For database table creation and data migration, I used Entity Framework Core ORM Tool, and Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio is used for database management purposes.

**Front-end Task:** Swagger API Documentation Support (Swagger UI is used to explore and test the APIs).

## Feedback

This is just a basic web system for my learning purpose.  
I'm planning to upgrade this system with some useful features, such as implementing security management, increasing performance level, and adding server-side and client-side verification and validation in the upcoming updates.
